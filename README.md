### A wrapper around [AyumiLove](https://ayumilove.net/), currently supporting portions of Raid: Shadow Legends and Awaken Chaos Era.
Intended for use with third-party tools such as Discord bots. Not associated with AyumiLove, I've just written this to make my life easier when trying to use game data in my other projects. Please support [their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ayumilove)!

 * Champions - Name, faction, rarity, skills, role, affinity, rank, book count, and URL
